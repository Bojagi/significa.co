  title: We are Significa
  content: |
    Now, what is Significa, you ask. Great question, sometimes we ask that too. 
    In a nutshell, Significa is a group of people helping other people creating, improving and getting their product off the runway. Together. With strategy, design and development. But does it really sum things up? We believe not.
    Ultimately, we believe in creating relationships, bonding with the people we collaborate with, them being companies or soon-to-be companies. We stand for helping them bond with their users too, through functionally beautiful digital experiences. 
    We're all in this together with one common goal: to make things happen whilst leveraging our shared knowledge. We know more when we know together.

    We do a lot of things, truly. But what matters is: we build and launch functional digital products while trying to make them look great in the process. And we're confident we do that pretty well too.

    Making it happen,
    with(out) chaos
  text: |
    Dealing with so many projects, with so many people, demands a certain amount of chaos, and foolishness. And there is both! But there's also strong-structured processes in place. 
    There's more where these 2 come from (a lot more, maybe too much).

clients:
  title: Pretentious? Nous?
  text: We could say a lot of things! We do this! We do that! How great we are! But it would always sound pretentious. Instead, hear it from who really matters.
  cta: Hear it from our clients

office:
  title: Our home, away from home
  text: We spent most of our awoke time at the office. It better be warm and plentiful in coffee. But most of all, laid-back and nuts!
  subtext: Renewed from an old, torn apart garage (former home to 40-ish collector cars), we've turned it into an amazing, 600sqm office space.
